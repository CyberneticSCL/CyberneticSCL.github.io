<hr align="left" width="85%" size="3" noshade color="#CCCCCC">
<p class="mmpHeader"><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
<p class="mmpNormalText"><FONT face=helvetica,sans-serif size=4>Why is the fatality rate from COVID19 50 fold higher in elderly male patients? Why do some cancers
recede while others grow? What causes allergies, arthritis, and chronic infection? The answer to these
questions is the failure of the immune system to correctly differentiate self from nonself - resulting, e.g.,
in tolerance to cancer and suppression of collagen (arthritis). Immunotherapy is an attempt to reverse
these immune decisions by amplifying either self or nonself signals - shifting the immune state toward a
tolerogenic or immunogenic bias. And yet, how can we use immunotherapy effectively when we still do
not have a clear understanding of how the self-nonself decision is made? While immunology has made
great strides in identifying the mechanics of hundreds of regulatory (self) and helper/effector (nonself)
pathways, this knowledge has not resulted in any certainty as to how the immune system as a whole
decides whether a unknown antigen (Ag) is harmless or hostile. The picture became slightly clearer with
the landmark studies in Johansen (2008) and Tam (2016) (JT), which used a novel experimental
framework to isolate the effect of changes in Ag (vaccine schedule (VS)) and show that this factor alone
can alter the self-nonself determination. Specifically, they concluded that if the Ag behaves like a threat,
then it is treated like a threat. This definitive experimental evidence begs the question of HOW a
decentralized network of immune cells and signals, with no central coordination or memory, differentiates
threatening behaviour from harmless? Our hypothesis, based on circuit analogues, and supported by
mathematical models, is that the delay between helper (Th) and regulatory T cell (Treg) response allows
the immune system to respond to the rate of increase in Ag, and that it is this signal which triggers a
broader immune response. The goal of this project, then, is to provide definitive experimental evidence
verifying this hypothesis. Specifically, inspired by the work of JT, we propose an innovative in vivo
experimental framework for isolating and controlling delay in immune response and use this framework
to show that by changing this delay, we can alter the self-nonself determination.</p>
