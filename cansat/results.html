<td WIDTH="70%"><font size=+1>The data from our flight demonstration corresponded
with the actual flight conditions quite nicely.&nbsp; We estimated the
temperature of the circuitry within the satellite to be at about 75 degrees
based on the calibration curve of the thermal sensor.&nbsp; Note that we
placed our thermal sensor such that we were not measuring ambient temperature
in the air, but rather the temperature of the circuitry in the satellite.
We noticed a slight increase in the rate of the beeps during flight, which
corresponded to the chips onboard the CanSat heating up.&nbsp; Although
75 degrees is still within the operating temperature ranges of the electrical
components onboard the spacecraft, overheating is certainly a valid concern
when it comes to electronics, and should be taken into consideration when
designing more sophisticated spacecraft that are meant to have longer operational
lifetimes.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Light level is difficult to quantify.&nbsp; However, the
data we obtained from the light sensor during flight did correspond with
the actual light conditions of a cloudy day as well as the calibration
points from previous trial runs of the circuit on the ground.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=+1>The payload onboard our CanSat was the demonstration of
a deployment mechanism.&nbsp; Upon ground command, the satellite successfully
deployed our dummy payload.</font></td>
