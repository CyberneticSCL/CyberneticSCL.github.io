<td WIDTH="70%"><font size=+1>The Procedure for building our CanSat was
as follows</font>
<h4>
<font size=+1>Structure</font></h4>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>To begin, we created a frame on which to mount the electronics
needed to operate the satellite. This was done taking copper-plated composite
fiber plate and cutting two circles and a rectangular piece. These pieces
were soldered together to form the shape of a soda can.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>Holes were then drilled in the frame to allow passage of
wires through the plate. Holes were then drilled for the bolts needed to
hold the circuit-boards in place.&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>A loop was attached to the top of the structure to hold the
parachute</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>Holes were drilled in the top of the can to allow the radio
antenna and volume know to stick out</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>Vector boards were cut to appropriate size to fit into the
CanSat.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>A sheet of plastic was cut into a circle and threaded to
create a drawstring pouch held shut by a nylon wire</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>A pepsi can was cut to allow the antenna, volume knob and
light sensor to protrude from the vehicle, as well as to allow access to
the on/off switch for the 12V power supply.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>A copper wire loop was soldered to the bottom of the top
circle of the frame from which to hang the payload</font></li>
</ul>

<h4>
<font size=+1>Electronics</font></h4>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>The circuit design was laid out on paper and the appropriate
positions found on the vector board.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>chip sockets were soldered in the appropriate locations</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>12V and 5V power and ground busses were laid out on the board</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The resisters, capacitors, osciallators, transistors, nicrome
wire, regulator and diodes were soldered to the board.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The 6 555 chips, the voltage inverter and the DTMF chip were
set into the board.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The connections depicted in the circuit diagram were made
to the chips and components using small gauge wire</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The speaker output from the radio was soldered to the input
of the DTMF chip</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The output from the 555 chips and transistors was connected
to the mike in and PTT connections on the radio</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The batteries were connected to the power switch and a line
from the 6V source connected to the radio. A line from the 12V source was
connected to the regulator on the circuit board</font></li>
</ul>

<h4>
<font size=+1>Assembly</font></h4>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+1>Once the circuit boards were prepared, the diassembled radio
cicuit board was first mounted to the frame using nuts, bolts and spacers.</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The circuit boards were then mounted to the opposite side
of the frame as the radio</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The battery assembly was mounted to the bottom of the frame</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The nylon wire holding the payload was threaded through the
copper loop at the top of the frame and twisted about the nicrome wire
before tying both ends together</font></li>

<li>
<font size=+1>The CanSat was now ready for deployment</font></li>
</ul>
