<td WIDTH="70%"><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The CanSat constructed
by this group had three main functions. All functions are activated by
the DTMF chip which interprets the input from the reciever as one of three
command choices</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Thermal Sensing</font></font></h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The first functional capability
of this satellite is the ability to measure system temperature. It is important
to monitor system temperature in satellites due to the sensitive nature
of electronics to heat. This temperature sensing capability is provided
by a one shot timer which triggers for a set period of time when the DTMF
chip outputs high. While the one-shot is triggered, a transistor outputs
a set voltage to the PTT function of the radio. During activation of the
one-shot timer, an oscillator is powered which outputs with frequency proportional
to the temperature of the thermister occupying the place of one of its
resistors. The output from this oscillator powers an oscillator that creates
a fixed frequency tone. The ouput from this oscillator runs to the radio
mike, which combined with the activation of the PTT function, causes the
radio to broadcast the beeps in audible form to the reciever on the ground.
The number of beeps in the period of the one-shot timer is proportional
to the temperature.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Light Sensing</font></font></h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The second functional capability
of this satellite is the ability to measure ambient light level. This Light
sensing capability is provided by a one shot timer which triggers for a
set period of time when the DTMF chip outputs high. While the one-shot
is triggered, a transistor outputs a set voltage to the PTT function of
the radio. During activation of the one-shot timer, an oscillator is powered
which outputs with frequency proportional to the temperature of the thermister
occupying the place of one of its resistors. The output from this oscillator
powers an oscillator that creates a fixed frequency tone. The ouput from
this oscillator runs to the radio mike, which combined with the activation
of the PTT function, causes the radio to broadcast the beeps in audible
form to the reciever on the ground. The number of beeps in the period of
the one-shot timer is proportional to the light level.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Payload Deployment</font></font></h4>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The payload capability of this
satellite is the ability to drop a payload on command from the ground control.
This is accomplished by running high current through a nichrome wire in
direct contact with a nylon wire which attaches the payload to the structure.
The nichrome wire heats quickly, melting the wire and releasing the payload.
When the DTMF chip outputs high in response to a command from the ground
unit, a voltage is applied to a current amplifier. The current amplifier
runs as long as the DTMF output is high. Activation of the payload typically
occurs within a second of triggering.&nbsp;</font></font></td>
